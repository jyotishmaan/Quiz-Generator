# Quiz-Generator
A tool that will enable one to randomly generate a quiz test questionnaire containing the specified number of questions from the question bank. The question bank and other related data need to be stored in a file/database or any other persistent structure as per the convenience. If it is a file, the system should ensure that the file exits and the path is specified. Or else a file is created with the specified name and stored in default location. Appropriate exception handling mechanism should be taken care of wherever required in the application. There should be options for separate question bank for separate subjects. The user should have the option of selecting the subject for which the question bank is to be made or the questionnaire is to be generated.
